# Description

What mod does this PR add integration for?

# Checklist

- [ ] Is the integration optional? I.e., does Thermoo Patches still work when the mod being integrated is NOT loaded?
- [ ] Has it been added to the `IntegratedMod` enum, for logging purposes (this applies even if the integration is fully data-driven)?
- [ ] Has a description for it been added to this README?
